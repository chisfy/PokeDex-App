My first look into fetching from an API and manipulating that data! This was achieved with JavaScript, HTML & CSS! 

Created around October 2023, as I look back, I can see the significant progress I have made! I remember struggling with CSS styling and also facing difficulties in retrieving data from the API, specifically in converting the first letter of Pok√©mon moves into capital letters to make it look neater. However, after a few weeks in the bootcamp, I managed to crack it and successfully achieved the intended conversion!
