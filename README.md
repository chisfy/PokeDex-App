My first look into fetching from an API and manipulating that data!
The main focus was to practice and understand a GET request from an external API.

## 🏫 Lessons Learned

<p align="center">
Created around October 2023, as I look back, I can see the significant progress I have made since!
Following this project, I gained further knowledge of JavaScript and CSS. In JavaScript, I explored new syntax, such as for loops, and deepened my understanding of how arrays behave. More importantly, I learned about architecture, specifically the separation of concerns, and how it can contribute to abstraction, creating reusable, and cleaner code.
</p>

## 💭 Reflections
<p align="center">
What went well? <br>
I remember struggling with CSS styling and also facing difficulties in retrieving data from the API, specifically in converting the first letter of Pokémon moves into capital letters to make it look neater. However, after a few weeks in the bootcamp, I managed to crack it and successfully achieved the intended conversion!
</p>

<p align="center">
What could be improved? <br>
The search bar function could be improved, at the moment it requires the exact spelling and in the case required. The search bar could improved to not be case-sensitive and allow for misspelling!
Another feature, perhaps one that allows for comparison between two pokemon so it could become like a game of top trumps!
CSS styling of course!
