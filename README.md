My first look into fetching from an API and manipulating that data! This was achieved with JavaScript, HTML & CSS! 

Created around October 2023, as I look back, I can see the significant progress I have made! I remember struggling with CSS styling and also facing difficulties in retrieving data from the API, specifically in converting the first letter of Pok√©mon moves into capital letters to make it look neater. However, after a few weeks in the bootcamp, I managed to crack it and successfully achieved the intended conversion!

The main focus was to practice and understand a GET request from an external API. Following this project, I gained further knowledge of JavaScript and CSS. In JavaScript, I explored new syntax, such as for loops, and deepened my understanding of how arrays behave. More importantly, I learned about architecture, specifically the separation of concerns, and how it can contribute to abstraction, creating reusable, and cleaner code.
