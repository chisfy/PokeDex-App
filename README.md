My first look into fetching from an API and manipulating that data! This was achieved with JavaScript, HTML & CSS! 

Created around October 2023, I look back and can see how large my progress has come along! I remember struggling with the CSS styling and also experienced difficulty in taking data from the api and converting the first tletter from the moves of a pokemon into capital letters to make it look a bit smarter. However, after a few weeks in the bootcamp I had manged to crack it and successfully convert it as intended!
